## My process

To create this project, I started by working on the HTML structure and then moved on to the CSS styling. I feel that with each project I make, I keep improving because this one was easier than the previous ones. I believe this progress is due to constant practice, which has made it possible

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this project, I had to learn new things, including how to adjust the spacing between lines in paragraphs using the line-height property

```html
    <div class="person">
      <div class="imageperson">
        <img src="/blog-preview-card-main/assets/images/image-avatar.webp" alt="Avatar" class="perfil">
      </div>
      <h4>Greg Hooper</h4>
    </div>```
```css
/*paragraph*/
p{
    color: hsl(0, 0%, 42%);
    line-height: 1.5;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
}
```

### Continued development

I feel that Iâ€™ve made good progress in HTML and CSS, so in the next few days, I plan to move on to JavaScript and then continue with React
